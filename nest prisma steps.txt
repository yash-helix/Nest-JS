In this session we'll be learning how to use prisma with nestJs and graphql while using postgresql as database.

1.  create a new nestJs project.

2.  install prisma using "npm install prisma --save-dev"

3.  after prisma is installed we will now write a schema for it.
    For that first I'll create a folder in the project as "prisma". Inside that folder i will create a prisma file named as "schema.prisma". In this file we will be having our database connection setup and the schemas for the tables. 
    First start with database configuration:
    code: 
        datasource db {
            provider = "postgresql"
            url = env("DATABASE_URL")
        }
    here, database connection is configured in the datasource block. We're using postgresql so we're providing it in the provider if it had been sqlite we would provide "sqlite" as provider.
    With PostgreSQL and MySQL, we need to configure the connection URL to point to the database server, this url will be stored in the .env file.
    ex: DATABASE_URL="postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"

4.  Now we can generate your SQL migration files and run them against the database.
    using the command in terminal: "npx prisma migrate dev --name init"
    migration files are created in the existing prisma folder.
